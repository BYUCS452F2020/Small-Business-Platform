# Application: Nate Teahan

### Why I am interested

I am interested in this platform because I am a small business owner. I deal with freelance videography and as such, I have experienced firsthand the pain of having to pay for multiple different subscriptions to manage a portfolio. Currently I post snippets of videos on my instagram, upload the entire video to Vimeo, and export the video to Dropbox for interaction with the clients I am working with. I also have to deal with communication through personal email to discuss scheduling and pricing. I would love for a platform to be able to handle all of these things in one location with one subscription.

### Business

As far as the business aspect of this application, I think that users would have no issue paying for a monthly or yearly subscription to it.

I also think that a tier system may be nice as well. Some businesses may not need the same amount of data that others might. In the same way that many cloud-based apps give a free (limited) access to their platform and charges past a certain threshold of data or usage, I believe this would also be a nice approach to this application as well.

### Legal

An LLC would be the cleanest way to go about this in my opinion. We would be dealing with lots of data and potential security issues could arise, and the more precautionary legal actions we take now, the better for us and the clients.

### Technical

A web first approach would be the most useful. If we are talking about viewing photos/videos, managing a schedule, or payments, most of these are handled more seamlessly on a computer. However a mobile application for both the businesses and the clients would be ideal. 

A language such as Javascript and frameworks such as React and React Native could be a potential solution for front-end development. As far as the backend goes, Java or Node.js seems like a great option.

### How I Will Contribute

As far as languages go, I have more breadth than depth, and I see this as an opportunity to really go deep into whatever langauges we may choose. I am a quick learner and am willing to enhance my skills with Javascript and andy framework that may come with it. I am also willing, and more than excited, to learn Node.js if that was the chosen language for the backend.

I am also a decent designer. Clean application design fascinates me and I am always looking for a way to implement a great user interface and a painless UX. Even though for this class project the frontend does not need to be the prettiest or most functional, I think that if we made it look nice and pretty from the get-go, then all the more power and advantage goes to us.
