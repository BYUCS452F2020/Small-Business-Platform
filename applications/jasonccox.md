# Application: Jason Cox

I'd like to help build this project!

## Why I'm Interested

I'm a big fan of small businesses and would love to have my own someday. Building a platform that allows them to focus less on operational hassles and more on their core offering sounds awesome.

### Business

I love the focus on building something that will be useful even for a single user. I'd like to be able to offer something helpful to your cousin and others even if the business doesn't explode. Additionally, I think this project has real potential to make money if we can nail that aspect of it.

I think charging a flat fee is a good place to start. Having different tiers based on business size, number of appointments, used features, etc. would be good to explore in the future. I'd also like to consider taking a small percent of the money that businesses make using our platform as well.

I'd also like to further flesh out the feature priorities. Building photo/video sharing, scheduling, and product listings all in just a few months is a big ask, so we may need to trim it down to just the most important functionality.

### Legal

An LLC sounds like a great choice to me -- the last thing I want is to get my clothes sued right off my back if we mess something up.

### Technical

The web is available pretty much everywhere, so I think that's a great choice for distribution. I'd love to explore something new besides just JavaScript, though -- maybe Go on the backend? I also think it would be wise to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript for the frontend (and the backend, if using Node.js).

## How I'll Contribute

I'd love to play a big role in building the backend and setting up the required infrastructure. I have experience creating a home server as well as using cloud providers like AWS and Digital Ocean. I'm also comfortable with Node.js and Java for building the backend, and I've dabbled in Go. I'd be happy to learn something new as well.

I'm willing to contribute on the front-end as well, but that's not my first preference. I'm skilled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have some experience with React and TypeScript as well. Once again, I'd be happy to learn a new framework.
